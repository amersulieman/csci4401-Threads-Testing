# csci4401-Threads-Testing
Naive implementation of sequential and Threads multiplying 2 2D matrices. 
Part A implements multiplying the matrices sequentially and using threads.
Part A folder also contain a README file to explain how to run the program.
Part B test the performance of sequential and threads algorithms from part A.
The difference is that Part A parses a file for the 2 matrices,
Part B generates matrices n x n from n=2 to 50 and test them
